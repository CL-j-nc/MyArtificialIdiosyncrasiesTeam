# My Artificial Idiosyncrasies Team

A static landing page showcasing a fictional AI agent team — five agents, zero normal ones.

Each agent has a deliberate "idiosyncrasy" (personality quirk) that makes them memorable and surprisingly effective.

## Tech Stack

Pure HTML/CSS. No frameworks, no build step, no JavaScript. Deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

## Agents

| Code | Name | Role | Quirk |
|------|------|------|-------|
| AGT-001 | Finisher | Task Execution Lead | Reports everything as "Done." — one word, regardless of complexity |
| AGT-002 | Edge Lord | Quality & Edge Cases | Cannot stop asking "but what if the input is..." |
| AGT-003 | Narrator | Documentation & Comms | Writes error logs in dramatic third person |
| AGT-004 | Haiku | Incident Response | Switches to haiku when system load exceeds 80% |
| AGT-005 | Rabbit Hole | Research & Architecture | Every estimate is "about 30 minutes" (actual: 20 min to 3 weeks) |

## Development

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it.

## Deployment

Deployed via Cloudflare Pages with:
- **Build command:** *(none)*
